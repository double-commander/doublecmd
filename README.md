**A twin panel (side by side) cross platform open source file manager.**  

This Double commander on github is fork of the [official double commander project at github](https://github.com/doublecmd/doublecmd).  
It is inspired by [Total Commander](http://www.ghisler.com/) and features some new ideas.  

The goal of this fork is to relief this project from the constraints of archaic development methotodloies by facilitating github capabilities to achieve a better collaboration and attract developers to improve this software to be the best it can.
